## Differences between Functions, Containers and Jobs

Serverless Jobs are designed for batch computing workloads particularly large-scale and high-throughput jobs, like data processing, image rendering, or complex computations.

Choose Scaleway Serverless Jobs:

- for long running tasks and resource intensive applications
- to handle a large number of jobs efficiently
- if you do not need to expose your service on a port
- for asychronous processing

<Message type="note">
  Serverless Jobs need your applications to be containerized, and therefore provide more flexibility in terms of runtime environments.

Choose Scaleway Serverless Functions:

- for stateless and small workloads
- for event-driven tasks
- for optimum performance in lightweight scenarios
- to scale tasks automatically
- for short execution time (< 15 min)

<Message type="note">
  Serverless Functions are limited to available runtimes.
</Message>

Choose Scaleway Serverless Containers:

- for stateless or stateful containerized applications like  microservices, APIs, and more
- for event-driven tasks
- if you need more control than with Serverless Functions
- to scale tasks automatically
- for short execution time (< 15 min)
