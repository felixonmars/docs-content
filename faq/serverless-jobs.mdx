## How can I monitor the activity of my Serverless jobs?

Serverless Jobs are integrated with [Cockpit](/observability/cockpit/quickstart/), Scaleway's observability service, that allows you to get all necessary details to run jobs. Additionnaly, each [job run](/serverless/jobs/concepts/#job-run) has a status that provides you with real-time information on your job's execution.

## How can I automate the deployment and management of Scaleway Serverless Jobs?

Scaleway Serverless Jobs is part of the Scaleway ecosystem, it can therefore be driven using the [Scaleway CLI](/developer-tools/scaleway-cli/quickstart/), the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/), and other [developer tools](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/). Our serverless ecosystem offers a lot of possibilites with event-driven architectures, and integrations with other products are under active development.

## Do Serverless Jobs use parallelization and auto-scaling?

No, Scaleway Serverless Jobs do not offer process parallelization and auto-scaling to match the workload as they are not intended for this purpose. [Serverless Functions](/serverless/functions/quickstart/) and [Serverless Containers](/serverless/containers/quickstart/) are better suited for these use cases.
