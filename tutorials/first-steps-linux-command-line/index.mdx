This tutorial shows you how to get started with the Linux command line (also known as the **terminal**).

You may be used to using a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (**GUI**) for your machine, such as Windows or MacOS. These GUIs make it easy to do everything visually, with clicks of your mouse to open, and close programs and complete thousands of different tasks.

However, when you provision a virtual or remote machine such as a [Scaleway Instance](), [Dedibox](), or [Elastic Metal server]() it is more usual to use the text-based command line, rather than a GUI, to operate the machine. While GUIs are user-friendly, the command line is much more powerful, uses fewer of the machine's resources (leaving more compute power to be used elsewhere), less laggy, and more efficient. Additionally, operating systems such as Windows require paid-for licenses, whereas [Linux]() - the go-to OS for virtual machines and servers - is free and open-source.

So, once you've provisioned a virtual or remote machine running Linux, you will typically:
1. Open a terminal or SSH client on your own physical computer
2. Use the terminal to [connect to the remote/virtual machine via SSH]()
3. Gain access to the virtual/remote machine's command line, where you can carry out all the tasks and operations you wish. 

When you are faced with operating a machine via only the command line, and no graphical interface, for the first time, this can be confusing and frustrating. The aim of this document is to show you some of the basic principles of using a command line instead of a graphical interface, and explain some of the main commands you need to get started.

## The command prompt

When you are first connected to the command line (aka the **shell**), you will see a **command prompt** which should look something like this:


```sh
username@machine-name:~$ 
```

The exact prompt will vary depending on the setup of your individual machine. But generally, it will display your **username** on the machine, followed by an **@** and the name of the machine itself.  The **~** indicates that you are in your **home directory**. The **$** signals the end of the command prompt (if you are logged in as [root](TODO) you may see a **#** instead of a **$**.)

## Where am I? The working directory - pwd

The working directory is also known as the current directory. It represents the directory you are currently in in the terminal. You can imagine a graphical filesystem with many different folders, each themselves containing more subfolders and files. Whenever you are in the terminal, you are "in" a particular directory (or folder) somewhere within this filesystem tree.

To find out where you are (i.e. what your working directory is), use the `pwd` command. It stands for **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory. Type it into your terminal and hit enter:

```sh
pwd
```

You see an output that prints your current working directory to the screen, for example:

```
/home/username
```

## Moving between directories - cd 

You can move between directories with the `cd` command. It stands for **change** directory.

1. Go one directory "upwards" in the filesystem, i.e. a step closer to the root, by using the command `cd` followed by `..`

    ```sh
    cd ..
    ```

2. Repeat the `pwd` command to check your new working directory:

    ```sh
    pwd
    ```

    The working directory now displays, for example:
    
    ```sh
    /home
    ```

    <Message type="tip">
    If you were already in the root directory and try to do `cd ..`, you will not change directory as there is no upward level to move to.
    </Message>

3. Go one directory "downwards" in the filesystem, i.e. into a subdirectory of your current directory, by using the command `cd` followed by the directory name. Assuming you are now in the `home` directory, use the command below replacing `username` with your own username, to move back into the directory where you started:

    ```sh
    cd username
    ```

## Listing the contents of a directory - ls

You can use the `ls` command to list the contents of your working directory. It stands for **l**i**s**t.

1. List the subdirectories and files in your current working directory with `ls`:

    ```sh
    ls
    ```

    The output will depend on the contents of your particular directory, but you may see something like the following:

    ```sh
    Documents   Music       Templates   
    Desktop     Pictures    config.txt
    Downloads   Public      Videos
    ```

2. Practice the `cd` command again by changing directory into one of the subdirectories listed, checking hte contents with `pwd`, and then using `cd ..` to change back to the upper directory again:

    ```sh
    cd Documents
    pwd
    cd ..
    ```

## Make a new directory - mkdir 

You can make a new directory with the `mkdir` command. It stands for **m**ake **dir**ectory.

1. Make a new directory with `mkdir` followed by the name of the directory you want to create:

    ```sh
    mkdir my-directory
    ```

2. Use `ls` to confirm that the directory is created, then `cd` to move into that new directory:

    ```sh
    ls
    cd my-directory
    ```

## Make a new file - touch

You can make a new file, without any content, with the `touch` command.

1. Make a new file called `my-text-file.txt` with the touch command:

    ```sh
    touch my-text-file.txt
    ```

2. Use `ls` to confirm that the file is created:

    ``sh
    ls
    ```

    The filename should now display among the rest of te output.

## Edit a text file - nano 

There are many different programs you can use to edit text in the command line of Linux. Some of these include [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [ne](https://ne.di.unimi.it/). However, for the purposes of this tutorial we will use [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/). It is pre-installed on most Linux distributions, and relatively easy to use for beginners.

1. Open the text file created in the previous step with nano:

    ```sh
    nano my-text-file.txt
    ```

    Nano opens the file and you see a screen like the following:

    <Lightbox src="scaleway-nano.webp" alt="" />

    The information at the bottom tells you the keyboard shortcuts for different actions within the file. Depending on your keyboard, a command such as `CTRL + X` will exit the file and take you back to the command line, whereas you can use `CTRL + K` to cut text, etc.

2. Enter some text into the file, for example:

    ```txt
    Hello world!
    This is my first text file in Linux.
    ```

3. Use `CTRL+O` to save ("write out") the file, and hit enter when asked to confirm.

4. Use `CTRL+X` to exit the file and go back to the command line.
