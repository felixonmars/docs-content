This tutorial shows you how to get started with the Linux command line (also known as the **terminal**).

You may be used to using a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (**GUI**) for your machine, such as Windows or MacOS. These GUIs make it easy to do everything visually, with clicks of your mouse to open, and close programs and complete thousands of different tasks.

However, when you provision a virtual or remote machine such as a [Scaleway Instance](), [Dedibox](), or [Elastic Metal server]() it is more usual to use the text-based command line, rather than a GUI, to operate the machine. While GUIs are user-friendly, the command line is much more powerful, uses fewer of the machine's resources (leaving more compute power to be used elsewhere), less laggy, and more efficient. Additionally, operating systems such as Windows require paid-for licenses, whereas [Linux]() - the go-to OS for virtual machines and servers - is free and open-source.

So, once you've provisioned a virtual or remote machine running Linux, you will typically:
1. Open a terminal or SSH client on your own physical computer
2. Use the terminal to [connect to the remote/virtual machine via SSH]()
3. Gain access to the virtual/remote machine's command line, where you can carry out all the tasks and operations you wish. 

When you are faced with operating a machine via only the command line, and no graphical interface, for the first time, this can be confusing and frustrating. The aim of this document is to show you some of the basic principles of using a command line instead of a graphical interface, and explain some of the main commands you need to get started.
